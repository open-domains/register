# Terms and Conditions  

# Introduction  
The Open Domains program is a free subdomain program that allows users to register and use subdomains under the is-local.org, is-not-a.dev, is-cool.dev, and localplayer.dev domains. By registering for and using a subdomain through the Open Domains program, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions.  

# Eligibility  
The Open Domains program is open to any individual or organization that agrees to these terms and conditions.  

# Minimum Age Requirement  
Participants in the Open Domains program must be at least 18 years old. By registering for a subdomain, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.  

# Subdomain Registration  
Users may register for a subdomain by submitting a registration form through the Open Domains website or via a GitHub pull request. The Open Domains team reserves the right to approve or reject any subdomain registration at its discretion.  

# NS Records Eligibility  
Users are eligible to request **NS records** if they make any kind of donation to the Open Domains project. However, eligibility does not guarantee approval, as the Open Domains team retains sole discretion over granting such requests.  
- Users who already have an NS record prior to November 2024 are unaffected by this policy change.  

# Use of Subdomains  
Subdomains registered through the Open Domains program may be used for any lawful purpose, provided that they do not infringe on the rights of any third party, or violate any applicable laws or regulations.  

# Content Restrictions  
Users are prohibited from using their subdomains to host or distribute any content that:  
- Is illegal, defamatory, discriminatory, or promotes hate or violence.  
- Contains adult content (e.g., pornography, explicit material, or any similar content).  
- Is aimed specifically at individuals under the age of 18.  

Subdomains found to violate these restrictions will be suspended or terminated.  

# Legal Requests  
If a legal request regarding a subdomain is sent to Open Domains (e.g., court orders, copyright claims, or government notices), the user who registered the subdomain agrees to:  
- Waive any claims or rights against Open Domains related to the subdomain in question.  
- Assume full responsibility for the content hosted on their subdomain and any associated legal consequences.  

Open Domains will cooperate with legal authorities and comply with applicable laws when responding to such requests.  

# Reporting Domain Abuse  
If you believe a subdomain is being used for abusive or unlawful purposes, please report it by contacting abuse@open-domains.net. Include all relevant details, such as the subdomain in question, the nature of the abuse, and any supporting evidence. Open Domains will investigate all reports and take appropriate action as necessary.  

# Public Suffix List (PSL)  
The domains used in the Open Domains program (is-local.org, is-not-a.dev, is-cool.dev, and localplayer.dev) are registered with and listed on the Public Suffix List (PSL). This ensures that browsers and internet services treat these domains appropriately for security and isolation purposes. Subdomains registered through the program are considered distinct entities and are not automatically granted access to cookies or other resources associated with the parent domain. For more information on the PSL, visit [https://publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org).  

# DNS Management  
The Open Domains program utilizes Cloudflare for DNS management, ensuring reliable and secure resolution of domain and subdomain queries. Cloudflare's services also include load balancing, proxy support, and protection against certain types of cyberattacks.  

# Liability  
Open Domains is not liable for any damages arising from the use of the subdomains or the Open Domains program. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the subdomains and the content hosted on them complies with all applicable laws and regulations.  

# Term and Termination  
The Open Domains program is offered on a continuing basis, but Open Domains reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the program at any time and for any reason, with or without notice.  

# Governing Law  
These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom. Any dispute arising out of or relating to these terms and conditions or the use of the subdomains shall be resolved in the courts of the United Kingdom.  

# Contact Information  
In the event that you have any questions or concerns about the Open Domains program or these terms and conditions, you may contact us at the following email addresses:

# Privacy and Security  
Users’ email addresses are public as of writing. Email addresses used in the Open Domains program may be publicly viewable on GitHub as part of the registration process. Additionally, IP addresses may be logged by our partner Cloudflare as part of load balancing and proxy support.  

# Funding  
The Open Domains program is free for users but relies on donations to operate.  

# Changes to Terms and Conditions  
Open Domains reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice. Users are responsible for reviewing these terms and conditions on a regular basis to ensure that they are aware of any changes.

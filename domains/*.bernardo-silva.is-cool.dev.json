The IP address is blocked on certain networks, the URL gets around this. I need the wildcard subdomain to allow me to access the services I host over secure https, without having to get an alternative domain for it. For example, I can host: uptime.bernardo-silva.is-cool.dev, coolify.bernardo-silva.is-cool.dev, portainer.bernardo-silva.is-cool.dev, pihole.bernardo-silva.is-cool.dev",

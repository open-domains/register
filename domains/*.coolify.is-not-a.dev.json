The IP address is blocked on certain networks, the URL gets around this. I need the wildcard subdomain to allow me to access the services that I host over secure https, without needing to get an alternative domain for it. For example, I can host the uptime monitor for my coolify on uptime.coolify.is-not-a.dev",
